# GifTastic

This program displays a list of buttons from an array in the JavaScript file. When a button is clicked, 10 gifs from the button's category are displayed. 

The user can animate or pause the gifs upon clicking them.

When a new button is clicked, the gifs from the previous button disappear and 10 new gifs appear pertaining to the new button. 

There is a search bar that allows the user to type in a word and generate a new button that will perform the same way the pre-set buttons do.
